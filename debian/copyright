 I agree to release all rights of images created by me into the public domain.
 You may do whatever you please with my images (my image is your image).
 Although I do not require you to do so, if you do happen to use my picture out

 much appreciated (I really need the ego boost). Also, if you use my picture
 for documents or other needs, it would be kind of you to credit me, although
 not required at all. Have fun!
